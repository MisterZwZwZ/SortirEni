# SortirENI
Here is an event website made with PHP/Symfony at ENI School.

## What is it ?
As a logged in user, this web app alows you to :
- browse events using criterias such as campus, dates, keywords, events that you registered to or created.
- display details about the event
- Register to an event if the event is not full
- Edit your profile
- create new events (setting names, dates, max capacity, location...)
- modify and cancel an event that you created
- As an admin, you can register a new user

## Why ? 
This is the result of a group project made with two other learners at ENI School. The main goal was to build a back-end web application with Symfony. 
The project lasted two weeks and alowed us to use many concept such as Fackers, Doctrine ORM, MVC Architecture, DOM interaction, AJAX...
